## 📅 Date
06-01-2026

## 📌 Objective
To explore data distribution and variability using advanced data visualization techniques for better analytical understanding.

## 🏪 Scenario
A startup analyzes e-commerce transaction data to understand customer spending behavior and detect abnormal purchase patterns using exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## 📂 Dataset
**File name:** `2.ecommerce_transactions.csv`

### Key Attributes:
- Transaction_ID
- Transaction_Date
- Transaction_Amount
- Category
- Customer_ID

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- R Programming Language
- ggplot2
- dplyr
- lubridate

## 🧪 In-Lab Tasks Performed
1. Plotted histogram of transaction amounts
2. Used boxplot to detect outliers
3. Created heatmap of monthly sales intensity

## 📊 Visualizations
- **Histogram:** Shows distribution of transaction amounts
- **Boxplot:** Identifies outliers and abnormal purchase values
- **Heatmap:** Displays monthly sales intensity across years

## 📈 Outcome
The analysis reveals customer spending patterns, identifies high-value transactions, and highlights seasonal trends in sales.

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open RStudio
2. Place the dataset in the working directory
3. Run the provided R script
4. View the generated visualizations

## ✅ Conclusion
Advanced visualization techniques such as histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps provide valuable insights into business data, supporting data-driven decision making and anomaly detection.
